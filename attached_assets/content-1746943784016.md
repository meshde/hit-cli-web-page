# The hit CLI ðŸ‘Š

[Permalink: The hit CLI ðŸ‘Š](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#the-hit-cli-)

`hit` is a productivity-focussed command-line API client that converts individual API endpoints into command-line commands.

## Installation

Support coming soon!

## Usage

[Permalink: Usage](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#usage)

`hit` works based on the config present in the current working directory. Specifically, the `.hit/config.json` file present in the current working directory. The contents of the config define what commands are available to run.

For example, if the config looks something like:

```
{
  "commands": {
    "list-users": {
        "url": "https://your.api.com/users",
        "method": "GET",
    }
  }
}
```

then this API call can be made like so:

```
hit run list-users
```

**The `.hit/` directory is meant to be added to git and hence can be shared by developers in a team.**

### Route Params

[Permalink: Route Params](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#route-params)

But API endpoint routes are never as simple as the example above. There can be any number of variables in the route. For example, an endpoint to retrieve a single user would include the id of the user to be retrieved in the route. `hit` would not be considered productivity-focussed if we had to go in and update the route in the config file every time we wanted to retrieve a different user.

To handle such cases, the `hit` config has the ability to specify which parts of the route represent variables and the values for such variables can then passed as command-line options. Variables can be denoted by prefixing them with colon `:`. So if the url in the config has `:userId`, then `userId` would be a variable.

For example, the route to retrieve a user can be added to our previous config like so:

```
{
  "commands": {
    "list-users": {
        "url": "https://your.api.com/users",
        "method": "GET",
    },
    "get-user": {
        "url": "https://your.api.com/users/:userId",
        "method": "GET",
    }
  }
}
```

and this can be invoked as follows to retrieve user with id `47`:

```
hit run get-user --user-id 47
```

Something similar can be done if the user id were to be passed in the query params instead of route params:

```
    "get-user": {
        "url": "https://your.api.com/users?id=:userId",
        "method": "GET",
    }
```

```
hit run get-user --user-id 47
```

### Environment Variables

[Permalink: Environment Variables](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#environment-variables)

Most software development set ups have multiple environments where their APIs are deployed such as a production/prod environment, a staging or dev or sandbox env or even separate environments for different features being developed. `hit` has the ability to define and use a set of variables that can have different values based on the currently active environment.

Environment variables can be used in the config by enclosing them in double curly braces ( `{{` `}}`) and can be defined in the config under the top level field `envs`.

```
{
  "envs": {
    "prod": {
      "API_URL": "https://prod.api.com"
    },
    "dev": {
      "API_URL": "https://dev.api.com"
    }
  },
  "commands": {
    "list-users": {
        "url": "{{API_URL}}/users",
        "method": "GET",
    },
    "get-user": {
        "url": "{{API_URL}}/users/:userId",
        "method": "GET",
    }
  }
}
```

An environment can be activated by running the command:

```
hit env use <env_name>
```

In the above example config, if the `prod` env is activated then all `run` commands using `{{API_URL}}` would use `https://prod.api.com` as the value for the variable.

As mentioned previously, the config file is meant to be committed to git and shared in a development team. The values for the environment variables would then also be automatically shared.

### Ephemeral Environment Variables

[Permalink: Ephemeral Environment Variables](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#ephemeral-environment-variables)

Environment variables discussed above are good for nearly-static variables that don't change often and would be good to share in the team but there might be variables in a workflow that are meant to be kept secret. Good examples of such variables are access tokens and api keys. For such variables, `hit` has support for "Ephemeral Environment Variables" or `ephenv` s

`ephenv` s can be set from the `hit` cli directly as opposed to in the config. `hit` stores these values in app settings on the local machine and hence these values don't show up in the config and are not shareable.

Here's an example of setting an API key:

```
hit ephenv set API_KEY secret_value_abcd_123
```

Such variables can then be used in the config similar to how environment variables are used by enclosing in double curly braces. For example:

```
{
  ...
  ...
  "commands": {
    "list-users": {
        "url": "{{API_URL}}/users?api_key={{API_KEY}}",
        "method": "GET",
    },
    ...
    ...
  }
}
```

### Request Headers

[Permalink: Request Headers](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#request-headers)

`hit` config allows you to provide the request headers that would need to be sent with each API call. The value of each header supports all kinds of variables:

1. variables representing command-line options that start with `:` (see section on Routing Params).
2. Environment variables enclosed in double curly braces.
3. Ephemeral environment variables enclosed in double curly braces.

For example, with the config

```
{
  ...
  ...
  "commands": {
    "list-users": {
        "url": "{{API_URL}}/users",
        "method": "GET",
        "headers": {
          "X-Authorization-Key": "{{API_KEY}}",
          "Origin": "{{API_URL}}",
          "X-Request-Id": ":customRequestId"
        }
    },
    ...
    ...
  }
}
```

the headers used when invoking command `list-users` would:

1. expect a command-line option `--custom-request-id` for the value of the header `X-Request-Id`.
2. use the value of `{{API_URL}}` from the active environment.
3. use the value of `{{API_KEY}}` from what was set in the app settings using the `hit ephenv set` command.

### Nested Sub-Commands

[Permalink: Nested Sub-Commands](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#nested-sub-commands)

So far we've covered being able to add commands directly as key-value pairs in the top level `commands` field of the config file. This works great in the beginning when we have just a few commands but as the number of api endpoints increase, our list of commands would also increase and it might get cluttered to maintain the commands. To add some sort of structure to the config file, the `hit` config supports organizing commands into nested sub-commands.

What this means is that instead of having to maintain commands like `get-user`, `list-users`, `delete-user`, `create-user`, we can organize the config to have a high level `users` command with the corresponding sub-commands as `get`, `list`, `delete`, `create`.

The config supports arbitrary level of nesting.

For example, with a config like so:

```
{
  "envs": {
    "prod": {
      "API_URL": "https://prod.api.com"
    },
    "dev": {
      "API_URL": "https://dev.api.com"
    }
  },
  "commands": {
    "users": {
      "list": {
          "url": "{{API_URL}}/users",
          "method": "GET",
      },
      "get": {
          "url": "{{API_URL}}/users/:userId",
          "method": "GET",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

the available commands would be:

```
hit run users list
hit run users get --user-id 47

```

### Inspecting the response of an API call

[Permalink: Inspecting the response of an API call](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#inspecting-the-response-of-an-api-call)

Normally, running a command would simply output the body of the response of the API call being made. If you would like to inspect the entire response including the status code and response headers, this can be done by running the command:

```
hit last view
```

### Postscripts

[Permalink: Postscripts](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#postscripts)

Postscripts allow you to run any script using the response of a particular API call. The script can be in any language/runtime that is supported on your machine. This can be useful if you want to perform any kind of action using the response of an API call. Some possible-use cases:

- The most common use-case for this would be to store an API token that can be obtained from a call to an authentication API endpoint. Using postscripts, the token in the response can be stored in the ephenv such that other commands are able to pass the token in the authentication headers.
- Another use-case would be to be able to always format the response of a particular command in a particular way. For example, an endpoint returns an array of objects and the command is expected to always display the json array in tabular format. This can be achieved adding a bash postscript to use `jq` to format the response or you could write a custom python/node script to do this as well.
- This can also be used to chain multiple commands together. For example, from the response of command A we can extract the necessary fields that command B expects as input and invoke command B in a bash based postscript.

#### Configuring Postscripts

[Permalink: Configuring Postscripts](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli/blob/master/README.md#configuring-postscripts)

1. All postscripts can be defined under the `postscripts` directory under the `.hit` directory. For example, if you have a script named `store_token.sh`, this would be at the path `.hit/postscripts/store_token.sh`
2. Which postscript to invoke after a particular command can be configured in the `postscript` field in that particular command's config. The `postscript` field has the following sub-fields:

1. `command`: This field specifies the run-time needed to invoke the script. This could be `bash` or `python` or `node` and so on.
2. `file`: This is the name of the file relative to the `postscripts` directory that needs to be invoked.

For example, with a config like so:

```
{
  "commands": {
    "login": {
      "url": "https://authenticate.com/login",
      "method": "POST",
      "body": {
        "user": ":user",
        "pass": ":pass"
      }
      "postscript": {
        "command": "bash",
        "file": "set_token.sh"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and a postscript file `postscrtips/set_token.sh` with contents like so:

```
hit ephenv set API_TOKEN `cat $HIT_RESPONSE_PATH`
```

Assuming the response of the login call would just be the API token as a string, running `hit run login --user username --password abcd1234` would fetch the token from the API endpoint and store it in the ephenv `API_TOKEN` for the rest of the hit commands to be able to use.

You canâ€™t perform that action at this time.
